1) Questions about the homework:
  1.1) What is your name and your partner's name?
I'm Yen-Chu Yu and my partner is Hoang Nguyen.


--------------------------------------------------------------
  1.2) How was the homework? Did you enjoy it?
It's a bit harder when I goes to part 2 because it contains a lot of reading and of course a lot of thing that 
I don't understand. But I really enjoy it anyway and feel learning a lot through it.




--------------------------------------------------------------
  1.3) Do you have any suggestions for improving the homework?
Not really, but maybe a few more test for part 2 that helps to break it into smaller steps.




--------------------------------------------------------------
2) Questions about your partner (skip if you worked solo):
  2.1) Which parts of the homework did you work on, and which parts did your partner program?
This time I finished the most part of part 2, Hoang help me read through the instructions but because he got many 
tests and lab to do since it's his senior year, I still implemented some more.



--------------------------------------------------------------
  2.2) How was your partnership? Do you feel you and your partner contributed equally to this homework?
Although the work we do is not very equal, but it's fine because there's always a time that we need to help each
other out and this is a big reason for partnering us up. Thus, I still think that we contributed equally to this
project.
